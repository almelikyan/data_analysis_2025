If there are significant correlations between variables do the principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. It's possible that you extract components not from all of the initially selected variables, but only from a subset of them. Interpret the results of the KMO measure. Provide a detailed description of each component and justify the choice of its name. Indicate the percentage of the variance of the original variables explained by the extracted components.
